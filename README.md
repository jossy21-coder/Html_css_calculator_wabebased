## Project Description: Simple Web-Based Calculator
### Project Overview:
This project is a web-based calculator designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is styled for a visually appealing user interface and provides interactive functionality for a seamless user experience.

### Features:
User-Friendly Interface:

A well-designed header titled "Sample Calculator".
Two input fields labeled 1st number and 2nd number for entering numerical values.
Arithmetic Operations:

Four buttons: Sum, Subtract, Multiply, and Division.
Clicking these buttons performs the respective operation and displays the result in a popup alert.
Clear Button:

A dedicated Clear button to reset the input fields.
Menu Button:
A hoverable menu button with a dropdown tooltip displaying sample notifications (e.g., friend requests, post updates).
Responsive Styling:
Stylish orange buttons with hover effects.
A bold red background for the calculator, enhancing the overall design.
Technical Details:
1) HTML:
Provides the structure of the calculator, including:
Input fields for user entries.
Buttons for operations and clearing input fields.
Dropdown menu functionality.
Key Components:

<input> tags: For user input.
<button> tags: For operation triggers.
Event Handlers: Inline onclick attributes to trigger JavaScript functions.

2) CSS:
Adds styling and visual appeal to the calculator.
Features include:
Red background for the calculator.
Rounded orange buttons with hover effects.
Dropdown menu with fade-in animation.
Key Styling Highlights:

Buttons are styled for usability and aesthetics.
Table layout for aligning input fields and labels.
Hover effects for interactivity.

3) JavaScript:
Provides functionality to perform arithmetic operations and handle user interactions.
Functions include:
sum(): Adds two numbers.
subtract(): Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiply(): Multiplies two numbers.
division(): Divides the first number by the second.
clr(): Clears the input fields.

### How It Works:
#### User Interaction:
The user enters two numbers into the input fields.
Clicking one of the operation buttons (Sum, Subtract, Multiply, Division) triggers the respective JavaScript function.
Result Display:

The result of the operation is displayed in a popup alert using the alert() method in JavaScript.
Clear Input:

Clicking the Clear button resets both input fields to empty.
Menu Interaction:

Hovering over the Menu button displays a dropdown list of notifications.
Code Structure:
HTML File (calculator.html):

Contains the structure of the calculator, input fields, buttons, and JavaScript function calls.
CSS File (calculator.css):

Provides styling for the calculator layout, buttons, table, and dropdown menu.
JavaScript Code (embedded in the HTML file):

Defines functions for performing operations, displaying results, and clearing inputs.
Key Features for Enhancement:
Replace the alert() display method with a dedicated output section below the buttons for showing results dynamically.
Add error handling for division by zero or invalid input.
Extend the functionality to include advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, power).
Make the calculator responsive for mobile devices using CSS media queries.
This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of creating an interactive web-based calculator using basic web development technologies. It is ideal for beginners learning how to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.ðŸ˜Šâ€‹
